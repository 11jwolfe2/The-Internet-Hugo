# Something New and Something Old

This is probably the greatest thing to happen to instant film since the [Impossible Project](https://us.polaroidoriginals.com/pages/about-us). A new camera with new integrated fatures, and the same great old school look we love from the original one step. I recently bought a [One Step 2](https://us.polaroidoriginals.com/products/onestep2-polaroid-camera?variant=971188568090), first to support Polaroid Originals as a company and movement, and secondly because it is awesome! It is great at taking photos with less waste than other instant films, since it has a built in rechargable battery. This will be the camera that revives instant film!

## Why Instant Film? Why Not Just Instant?

I once heard someone talk about instant film and how it is a tangible memory, it is great at taking you back to that time and place of the photo. Unlike digital you take a few instant film shots and your remember them. With digital you take hounds of thousands of pictures that you bearly look at and they take up hard drive space. Where a few Polaroid instant film photos in a box can transport you anywhere.

## Should You Get One

Well ultimently this is a question you have to answer yourself, I can guide you and I defiently recomend one but its always your choice. But ask yourself these Questions:

#### Do you want to make your memories even more memorable?
#### Do you want to be the hit of the Party?
#### Do you want a collection of timeless photos?
#### Are you new to instant film?
#### Are you expierence with instant film?
#### Do you love Polaroids?

If you said yes to any of these questions or thought "Hmmm that sounds cool." then I say you should get one. It is a new way to take photos even for those of us that have been taking 600 film shots for years, or decades. 

## Things you might need

## One Step 2

Obviously you will the need the camera to shoot with. If you have an old polaroid you could start there, see my other blog post on [Different Types of Polaroids(/DifferentTypesOfPolaroids)].

### Where to Buy?
I personally got mine on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xone+step+.TRS0&_nkw=one+step+2&_sacat=0) because I had a coupon, and it came with two packs of film. But if your looking online the best place is to get it direct for [Polaroid Originals Site](https://us.polaroidoriginals.com/products/onestep2-polaroid-camera?variant=971188568090). If you cant wait and are in a hurry you have two options. 

First is Amazon if your a prime member its free 2 day shipping.

## Type 600I Film

This is the film used in the new One Step 2 as it does not have a battery in the film pack, this makes it about $3 per pack cheeper than type 600 film, at $15.99. 

### Where to Buy?

#### Prices are as of March 2018. 

## Accessories

A good tripod is nice to help you get in your own phots. The timer and flash are built into the camera so you wont need one of those. Maybe a carring case, I personally Like this [one](https://us.polaroidoriginals.com/products/box-camera-bag-white). 

### Where to Buy?

Thats really all you need to start shooting.
