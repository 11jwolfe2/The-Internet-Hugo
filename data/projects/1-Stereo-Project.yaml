description: <p>I am an Electrical Engineering student and loved this project! Some may ask where I got this and how much I put into this, the answer is easy, my local Goodwill and $10. If you need more help or have any questions please ask as there is a lot of knowledge and every unit is different. *Please remember to look at all pictures as most have comments that might help identify parts.</p> </p> <strong>Want to know how all of this was done?  </strong>You can view the whole tutorial <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Restoration-of-a-1965-Sylvania-SC773C-Stereo-Conso/">here</a>.</p>
